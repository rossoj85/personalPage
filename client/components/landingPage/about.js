                            Hi, my name is Jason. I am a Fullstack Javascript developer, software engineer, former teacher and world-traveler.
                            I first discovered my love for code about a year and a half ago upon returning home from a long stint working abroad 
                            and realized that my passion for studying human language extended to learning computer language as well. <br/>
                            <br/>
                            I spent about six months teaching myself Javascript and then enrolled in Fullstack Academyâ€™s Immersive Software Engineering Program 
                            where my knowledge grew exponentially. My current specialty is building React.js applications in a Node.js environment, but I enjoy 
                            working throughout the stack and am always open to learning with new technologies.  I love what I do because I am constantly improving, 
                            creating amazing things, collaborating with great people and pushing the boundaries of what is possible everyday. 
                            </p> 
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                </ScrollableAnchor>
        )
    }
